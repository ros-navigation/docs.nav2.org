Projects for 2021 Summer Student Program
########################################

The `Summer 2021 Student Program <https://summer.iscas.ac.cn/help/en/student/>`_ is upon us!
See below for the list of project proposals for students to review and apply for.
This is by no means the only list of potential projects, please check our issue tracker or propose another if there's something you think you're well suited for that would be useful for Nav2.

If you have any questions, wish to ask questions, or generally reach out, you are encouraged to do so!
We have a community Slack at `navigation2.slack.com <https://navigation2.slack.com>`_.
If you are unable to access it due to not being able to sign up, please send an email to the mentor in the details below and they can manually add you.

Additionally, we have ROS community Discourse.
If you post on `this discourse page <https://discourse.ros.org>`_ regarding Nav2, a maintainer will respond.
We have the sub-topic Navigation Stack that may be used `here <https://discourse.ros.org/c/navigation/44>`_.
It is preferred you post in this sub-topic.

For general ROS questions, please use `ROS Answers <https://answers.ros.org/>`_.

Have fun and we look forward to working with you this summer!
