Jazzy to K-Turtle
#################

Moving from ROS 2 Jazzy to K-Turtle, a number of stability improvements were added that we will not specifically address here.


New RViz panel for Docking
**************************

In `PR #4458 <https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2/pull/4458>`_ a new RViz panel was added to interact with the Docking Server.

This panel allows the user to:

- Dock the robot to a charger, selecting the dock id or the dock pose and type. It also allows the user to set whether or not to navigate to the staging pose.
- Undock the robot from a charger.

The panel displays the action goal status and feedback published by ``nav2_msgs/DockRobot`` and ``nav2_msgs/UndockRobot`` actions. Users can find information such as elapsed time, number of retries and the current state of the action (staging, controlling, etc.), as well as the error codes of the action.


Here we can see the working demo of the plugin:

.. attention:: If the docking server is unavailable, then the combo box of the dock type will be empty.

New BT Nodes
