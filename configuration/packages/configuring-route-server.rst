Route Server
############

Source code on Github_.

.. _Github: https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2/tree/main/nav2_route

The Route Server in ``nav2_route`` implements the server for computing routes through a predefined navigation graph rather than using freespace planning like the Planner Server.
It may be used to fully replace freespace planning when following a particular route closely or to augment the global planner with long-distance routing to a goal.
In this case, the planner will generate feasible paths with localized environmental information for only the future part of the route necessary.

The graph itself has very few rules associated with it, but may be generated manually or automatically via AI, geometric, or probabilistic techniques.
See :ref:`route_graph_generation` for a tutorial about how to generate a graph using QGIS.

There are also several locations for customization using plugins:
* Edge Scorer: Enables custom scoring functions for edges based on arbitrary user-defined semantic information and the chosen optimization criteria(s).
* Route Operation: Execute a user-defined action when entering or leaving a route edge or achieving a node, including use of node and edge semantic information,
* Route Graph Parser: Parse graph files using the chosen format (e.g. geoJSON, OpenStreetMap, etc.) and convert them into the internal graph representation.

See the package's README file for additional information such as performance metrics, design, advice, and graph formatting.

Set this generously based on path tracking tolerances.

StartPoseOrientationScorer
--------------------------

This edge scoring plugin will score an edge starting at the start node (vector from start->goal) based on its angular proximity to the starting pose's orientation.
This will either score a weighted-angular distance or reject traversals that are outside of a set threshold to force the route to go down a particular direction (i.e. direction robot is already facing).

DynamicEdgesScorer
------------------

This edge scoring plugin will score based on the requested values from a 3rd party application via a service interface.
It can set dynamically any cost for any edge and also be used to close and reopen particular edges if they are blocked, in use by other robots locking out its shared use by other robots, higher cost due to overlap with other platforms in service, increased cost due to fleet manager analytics that this space is underperforming throughput, or otherwise temporarily non-traversible.
For example, if other robots report an edge to be blocked, all robots can avoid this edge/aisle/etc.

It has no parameters.

Route Operations Parameters
***************************

AdjustSpeedLimit

  Type           Default
  -------------- ----------------------------
  double         1.0

  Type           Default
  -------------- ----------------------------
  bool           true
  ============== ============================

  ============== ============================
  Type           Default
  -------------- ----------------------------
  string         abs_time_taken
  ============== ============================

  Description
    Metadata tag to write the time taken to within an edge. Is used with the ``TimeScorer`` to give an improved experiential estimate of traversal times.


ReroutingService
----------------

This route operation will receive service requests from a 3rd party application to cause a rerouting request.
