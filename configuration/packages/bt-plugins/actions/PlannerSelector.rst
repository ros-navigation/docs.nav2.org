PlannerSelector
===============

It is used to select the planner that will be used by the planner server. It subscribes to the ``planner_selector`` topic to receive command messages with the name of the planner to be used. It is commonly used before of the ComputePathToPoseAction. The ``selected_planner`` output port is passed to ``planner_id`` input port of the ComputePathToPoseAction. If none is provided on the topic, the ``default_planner`` is used.

Any publisher to this topic needs to be configured with some QoS defined as ``reliable`` and ``transient local``.
