GoalCheckerSelector
===================

It is used to select the GoalChecker that will be used by the goal_checker server. It subscribes to the ``goal_checker_selector`` topic to receive command messages with the name of the GoalChecker to be used. It is commonly used before of the FollowPathAction. The ``selected_goal_checker`` output port is passed to ``goal_checker_id`` input port of the FollowPathAction. If none is provided on the topic, the ``default_goal_checker`` is used.

Any publisher to this topic needs to be configured with some QoS defined as ``reliable`` and ``transient local``.
