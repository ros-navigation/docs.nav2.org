.. _bt_controller_selector_node:

ControllerSelector
==================

It is used to select the Controller that will be used by the Controller server. It subscribes to the ``controller_selector`` topic to receive command messages with the name of the Controller to be used. It is commonly used before of the FollowPathAction. The ``selected_controller`` output port is passed to ``controller_id`` input port of the FollowPathAction. If none is provided on the topic, the ``default_controller`` is used.

Any publisher to this topic needs to be configured with some QoS defined as ``reliable`` and ``transient local``.
