PathLongerOnApproach
====================

This node checks if the newly generated global path is significantly larger than the old global path in the user-defined robot's goal proximity and triggers their corresponding children. This allows users to enact special behaviors before a robot attempts to execute a path significantly longer than the prior path when close to a goal (e.g. going around an dynamic obstacle that may just need a few seconds to move out of the way).
