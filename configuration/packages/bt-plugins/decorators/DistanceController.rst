DistanceController
==================

A node that controls the tick rate for its child based on the distance traveled.
The distance to be traveled before replanning can be supplied to the node as a parameter.
The node returns RUNNING when it is not ticking its child. Currently, in the navigation
stack, the ``DistanceController`` is used to adjust the rate at which the ``ComputePathToPose`` and ``GoalReached`` nodes are ticked.
