Denoise Layer Parameters
========================

This layer attempts to remove simple noise that may exist in a costmap's layers due to sensor noise or discrete raycasting errors.

``<denoise layer>`` is the corresponding plugin name selected for this type.

:``<denoise layer>``.enabled:

  ==== =======
  Type Default
  ---- -------
  bool True
  ==== =======

  Description
    Whether it is enabled.

:``<denoise layer>``.minimal_group_size:

  ==== =======
  Type Default
  ---- -------
  int  2
  ==== =======

  Description
    The minimum number of adjacent obstacles that should not be discarded as noise.

    | If 1 or less, all obstacles will be kept.
    | If 2, standalone obstacles (without neighbors in adjacent cells) will be removed.
    | If N, obstacles groups smaller than N will be removed.

:``<denoise layer>``.group_connectivity_type:

  ====== =======
  Type   Default
  ------ -------
  int    8
  ====== =======

  Description
    Obstacles connectivity type (is the way in which obstacles relate to their neighbors).
