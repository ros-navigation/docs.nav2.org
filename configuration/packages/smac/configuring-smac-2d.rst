  double         0.125  
  ============== =======

  Description
    Tolerance in meters between requested goal pose and end of path.

  Type Default

  ---- -------
  int  1            
  ==== =======

  Description
    Multiplier factor to downsample costmap by (e.g. if 5cm costmap at 2 ``downsample_factor``, 10cm output).

:``<name>``.allow_unknown:

  ==== =======
  Type Default                                                   
  ---- -------
  bool True            
  ==== =======

  Description
    Whether to allow traversing/search in unknown space.

:``<name>``.max_iterations:

  ==== =======
  Type Default                                                   
  ---- -------
  int  1000000            
  ==== =======

  Description
    Maximum number of search iterations before failing to limit compute time, disabled by -1.

:``<name>``.max_on_approach_iterations:

  ==== =======
  Type Default                                                   
  ---- -------
  int  1000            
  ==== =======

  Description
    Maximum number of iterations after the search is within ``tolerance`` before returning approximate path with best heuristic if exact path is not found.

:``<name>``.max_planning_time:

  ====== =======
  Type   Default                                                   
  ------ -------
  double  2.0            
  ====== =======

  Description
    Maximum planning time in seconds.

:``<name>``.cost_travel_multiplier:

  ====== =======
  Type   Default                                                   
  ------ -------
  double 2.0            
  ====== =======

  Description
    Cost multiplier to apply to search to steer away from high cost areas. Larger values will place in the center of aisles more exactly (if non-`FREE` cost potential field exists) but take slightly longer to compute. To optimize for speed, a value of 1.0 is reasonable. A reasonable tradeoff value is 2.0. A value of 0.0 effective disables steering away from obstacles and acts like a naive binary search A*.

:``<name>``.use_final_approach_orientation:

  ====== =======
  Type   Default                                                   
  ------ -------
  bool   false      
  ====== =======

  Description
    If true, the last pose of the path generated by the planner will have its orientation set to the approach orientation, i.e. the orientation of the vector connecting the last two points of the path

:``<name>``.smoother.max_iterations:

  ====== =======
  Type   Default                                                   
  ------ -------
  int    1000         
  ====== =======

  Description
    The maximum number of iterations the smoother has to smooth the path, to bound potential computation.

:``<name>``.smoother.w_smooth:

  ====== =======
  Type   Default                                                   
  ------ -------

  ====== =======

  Description
    Weight for smoother to apply to smooth out the data points

:``<name>``.smoother.w_data:

  ====== =======

  ====== =======

  Description
    Weight for smoother to apply to retain original data information

:``<name>``.smoother.tolerance:

  ====== =======
  Type   Default

  Description
    Parameter tolerance change amount to terminate smoothing session
