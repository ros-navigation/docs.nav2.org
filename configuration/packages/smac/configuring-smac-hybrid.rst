:``<name>``.max_iterations:

  ==== =======
  Type Default

  ==== =======

  Description
    Maximum number of iterations once a visited node is within the goal tolerances to continue to try to find an exact match before returning the best path solution within tolerances. Negative values convert to infinite.

:``<name>``.max_planning_time:

  ====== =======
  Type   Default

  double 3.0            
  ====== =======

  Description
    If the length is too far, reject this expansion. This prevents shortcutting of search with its penalty functions far out from the goal itself (e.g. so we don't reverse half-way across open maps or cut through high cost zones). This should never be smaller than 4-5x the minimum turning radius being used, or planning times will begin to spike.

  bool   false         
  ====== =======

  Description
    Whether to publish expansions on the ``/expansions`` topic as an array of poses (the orientation has no meaning). WARNING: heavy to compute and to display, for debug only as it degrades the performance.

  ------ -------
  bool   true       
  ====== =======

  Description
    Performs extra refinement smoothing runs. Essentially, this recursively calls the smoother using the output from the last smoothing cycle to further smooth the path for macro-trends. This typically improves quality especially in the Hybrid-A* planner due to the extra "wobbling" it can have due to the very small primitive lengths but may cause the path to get slightly closer to some obstacles.

:``<name>``.smoother.refinement_num:

  ============== ===========================
  Type           Default                    
  -------------- ---------------------------
  int            2   
  ============== ===========================

  Description
    Number of times to recursively attempt to smooth, must be ``>= 1``.
