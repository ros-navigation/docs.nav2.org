Overview
========

This document serves as a reference guide to the main behavior tree (BT) used in Nav2,
and explains the process for customizing this BT.

There are many example behavior trees provided in ``nav2_bt_navigator/behavior_trees``,
but these sometimes have to be re-configured based on the application of the robot. 
The following tutorial will walk through the current main default BT ``navigate_w_replanning_and_recovery.xml``
and will show users how to modify this BT in potentially useful ways, using the example of developing a BT that follows a predefined path.

Prerequisites
=============

- Have a valid installation of Nav2 (see the `getting started guide <../../getting_started/index.html>`_)

- Have a robot (simulated, or physical) that can be used for testing that can already navigate with Nav2

- Become familiar with the concept of a behavior tree before continuing with this tutorial
    - Read the short explaination in `navigation concepts <../../concepts/index.html>`_
    - Read the general tutorial ang guide (not Nav2 specific) on the `BehaviorTree CPP V3 <https://www.behaviortree.dev/>`_ website. Specifically, the "Learn the Basics" section on the BehaviorTree CPP V3 website explains the basic generic nodes that will be used that this guide will build upon

Introduction To Nav2 Specific Nodes
===================================
.. warning::
    Vocabulary can be a large point of confusion here when first starting out.
        - A ``Node`` when discussing BT is entirely diferent than a ``Node`` in the ROS2 context
        - A ``Recovery`` in the context of BT is different than a navigation ``Recovery`` behavior
        - An ``ActionNode`` in the context of BT is not necessarily connected to an Action Server in the ROS2 context (but often it is)

There are quite a few custom Nav2 BT nodes that are provided to be used in the Nav2 specific fashion. Some commonly used Nav2 nodes will be described below.
The full list of custom BT nodes can be found in the `nav2_behavior_tree plugins folder <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/tree/main/nav2_behavior_tree/plugins>`_.
The `configuration guide <../../configuration/packages/bt-plugins/configuring-bt-xml.html>`_ can also be quite useful.

Action Nodes
------------

- ComputePathToPose - ComputePathToPose Action Server Client (Planner Interface)
- FollowPath - FollowPath Action Server Client (Controller Interface)
- Spin, Wait, Backup - Recoveries Action Server Client (System Recoveries)
- ClearCostmapService - ClearCostmapService Server Clients (Contextual Recovery)

The above Action Nodes are all action server clients to their respective action server that will call their action on the first tick of the action node. 
Upon completion, these action nodes will return ``SUCCESS`` if the action server believes the action has been completed correctly, ``RUNNING`` when still running, and will return ``FAILURE`` otherwise. Note that in the above list,
the `ClearCostmapSerice` action node is *not* an action server client, but a service client.

Condition Nodes
---------------

- GoalUpdated
- GoalReached
- InitialPoseReceived
- isBatteryLow

The above list of condition nodes can be used to probe particular aspects of the robot, or the navigation status. They will return ``SUCCESS`` is ``TRUE`` and ``FAILURE`` when ``FALSE`` typically.
The key condition that is used in the default Nav2 BT is ``GoalUpdated`` which is checked asynchronously at times. This condition node allows for the behavior described as "If the goal has updated, then we must replan".
Condition nodes are typically paired with ReactiveFallback nodes.

Decorator: Rate Controller
--------------------------
The rate controller node helps control the ticking of it's children nodes. The tick rate is an exposed blackboard parameter, it is being used in the default Nav2 BT to limit the rate at which the ``ComputePathToPose`` action node is called.

Control: PipelineSequence
-------------------------
The PipelineSequence control node re-ticks previous children when a child returns ``RUNNING``.
This node is similar to the ``Sequence`` node, with the additional property that the children prior to the "current" are reticked, (resembling the flow of water in a pipe).
If at any point a child returns ``FAILURE``, all children will be halted and the parent node will also return  ``SUCCESS``. Upon ``SUCCESS`` of the last node in the sequence, this node will halt and return ``SUCCESS``.

To explain this further, here is an example BT that uses PipelineSequence.

|

 .. image:: images/custom_behavior_tree/control_pipelineSequence.png
    :align: center

|                  

.. code-block:: xml

    <root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
        <BehaviorTree ID="MainTree">
            <PipelineSequence>
                <Action_A/>
                <Action_B/>
                <Action_C/>
            </PipelineSequence>
        </BehaviorTree>
    </root>

1. ``Action_A``, ``Action_B``, and ``Action_C`` are all IDLE. 
2. When the parent PipelineSequence is first ticked, let's assume ``Action_A`` returns ``RUNNING``. The parent node will now return ``RUNNING`` and no other nodes are ticked.

|

 .. image:: images/custom_behavior_tree/control_pipelineSequence_RUNNING_IDLE_IDLE.png
    :align: center

| 

3. Now, let's assume ``Action_A`` returns ``SUCCESS``, ``Action_B`` will now get ticked and will return ``RUNNING``. ``Action_C`` has not yet been ticked so will return ``IDLE``.

|

 .. image:: images/custom_behavior_tree/control_pipelineSequence_SUCCESS_RUNNING_IDLE.png
    :align: center

| 

4. ``Action_A`` gets ticked again and returns ``RUNNING``, and ``Action_B`` gets re-ticked and returns ``SUCCESS`` and therefore the BT goes on to tick ``Action_C`` for the first time. Let's assume ``Action_C`` returns ``RUNNING``. The retick-ing of ``Action_A`` is what makes PipelineSequence useful.

|

 .. image:: images/custom_behavior_tree/control_pipelineSequence_RUNNING_SUCCESS_RUNNING.png
    :align: center

| 

5. All actions in the sequence will be re-ticked. Let's assume ``Action_A`` still returns ``RUNNING``, where as ``Action_B`` returns ``SUCCESS`` again, and ``Action_C`` now returns ``SUCCESS`` on this tick.The sequence is now complete, and therefore ``Action_A`` is halted, even though it was still ``RUNNING``.

|

 .. image:: images/custom_behavior_tree/control_pipelineSequence_RUNNING_SUCCESS_SUCCESS.png
    :align: center

| 

Recall that if ``Action_A``, ``Action_B``, or ``Action_C`` returned ``FAILURE`` at any point  of time, the parent would have returned ``FAILURE`` and halted any children as well.

Control: Recovery
---------------------
The Recovery control node has only two children and returns ``SUCCESS`` if and only if the first child returns ``SUCCESS``. 
If the first child returns ``FAILURE``, the second child will be ticked. This loop will continue until either:

- The first child returns ``SUCCESS`` (which results in ``SUCCESS`` of the parent node)
- The second child returns ``FAILURE`` (which results in ``FAILURE`` of the parent node)
- The ``number_of_retries`` input parameter is violated.

This node is usually used to link together an action, and a recovery action as the name suggests. The first action will typically be the "main" behavior,
and the second action will be something to be done in case of ``FAILURE`` of the main behavior. Often, the ticking of the second child action will promote the chance the first action will succeed.

|

 .. image:: images/custom_behavior_tree/control_recovery_node.png
    :align: center

| 

.. code-block:: xml

    <root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
        <BehaviorTree ID="MainTree">
            <RecoveryNode number_of_retries="1">
                <ComputePathToPose/>
                <ClearLocalCostmap/>
            </RecoveryNode>
        </BehaviorTree>
    </root>

In the above example, let's assume ``ComputePathToPose`` fails. ``ClearLocalCostmap`` will be ticked in response, and return ``SUCCESS``.
Now that we have cleared the costmap, lets' say the robot is correctly able to compute the path and ``ComputePathToPose`` now returns ``SUCCESS``. Then, the parent RecoveryNode will also return ``SUCCESS`` and the BT will be complete.

Control: RoundRobin
-----------------------
The RoundRobinNode ticks it's children in a round robin fashion until a child returns ``SUCCESS``, in which the parent node will also return ``SUCCESS``. 
If all children return ``FAILURE`` so will the parent RoundRobin.

Here is an example BT we will use to walk though the concept.

 .. image:: images/custom_behavior_tree/control_round_robin.png
    :align: center

|                  

.. code-block:: xml

    <root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
        <BehaviorTree ID="MainTree">
            <RoundRobin>
                <Action_A/>
                <Action_B/>
                <Action_C/>
            </RoundRobin>
        </BehaviorTree>
    </root>

1. All the nodes start at IDLE

|

 .. image:: images/custom_behavior_tree/control_round_robin_IDLE_IDLE_IDLE.png
    :align: center

| 

2. Upon tick, the first child is ticked. Let's assume it returns ``RUNNING``. In this case, no other children are ticked and the parent node returns ``RUNNING`` as well.

|

 .. image:: images/custom_behavior_tree/control_round_robin_RUNNING_IDLE_IDLE.png
    :align: center

| 

3. Upon the next tick, let's assume that ``Action_A`` returns ``FAILURE``. This means that ``Action_B`` will get ticked next, and ``Action_C`` remains unticked. 
Let's assume ``Action_B`` returns ``RUNNING`` this time. That means the parent RoundRobin node will also return ``RUNNING``.

|

 .. image:: images/custom_behavior_tree/control_round_robin_FAILURE_RUNNING_IDLE.png
    :align: center

| 

4. Upon this next tick,  let's assume that ``Action_B`` returns ``SUCCESS``. The parent RoundRobin will now halt all children and returns ``SUCCESS``. 
The parent node retains this in it's state, and will tick ``Action_C`` upon the next tick rather than start from ``Action_A`` like Step 2 did.

|

 .. image:: images/custom_behavior_tree/control_round_robin_FAILURE_SUCCESS_IDLE.png
    :align: center

| 

5. On this tick, let's assume ``Action_C`` returns``RUNNING``, and so does the parent RoundRobin.

|

 .. image:: images/custom_behavior_tree/control_round_robin_FAILURE_SUCCESS_RUNNING.png
    :align: center

| 

   
6. On this last tick, let's assume ``Action_C`` returns ``FAILURE``. The parent will circle and tick ``Action_A`` again. ``Action_A`` returns ``RUNNING`` and so will the parent RoundRobin node. This pattern will continue indefinitely.

Navigate With Replanning and Recovery
=====================================

The following section will describe in detail the concept of the main and default BT currently used in Nav2, ``navigate_w_replanning_and_recovery.xml``.
This behavior tree replans the global path periodically at 1 Hz and it also has recovery actions.

BTs are primarily defined in XML. The tree shown above is represented in XML as follows.

.. code-block:: xml

    <root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
        <BehaviorTree ID="MainTree">
            <RecoveryNode number_of_retries="6" name="NavigateRecovery">

                        </RecoveryNode>

                    <RecoveryNode number_of_retries="1" name="FollowPath">
                        <FollowPath path="{path}" controller_id="FollowPath"/>

                        </ReactiveFallback>
                    </RecoveryNode>
                </PipelineSequence>
                <ReactiveFallback name="RecoveryFallback">
                    <GoalUpdated/>
                    <RoundRobin name="RecoveryActions">
                        <Sequence name="ClearingActions">
                            <ClearEntireCostmap name="ClearLocalCostmap-Subtree" service_name="local_costmap/clear_entirely_local_costmap"/>
                            <ClearEntireCostmap name="ClearGlobalCostmap-Subtree" service_name="global_costmap/clear_entirely_global_costmap"/>
                        </Sequence>
                        <Spin spin_dist="1.57"/>
                        <Wait wait_duration="5"/>
                        <BackUp backup_dist="0.15" backup_speed="0.025"/>
                    </RoundRobin>
                </ReactiveFallback>
            </RecoveryNode>
        </BehaviorTree>
    </root>
                                                                                                                

This is likely still a bit overwhelming, but this tree can be broken into two smaller subtrees that we can focus on one at a time.
These smaller subtrees are the children of the top-most ``RecoveryNode``, let's call these the ``Navigation`` subtree and the ``Recovery`` subtree.
This can be represented in the following way:

|

 .. image:: images/custom_behavior_tree/overall_bt_w_breakdown.png
    :align: center

|          


The ``RecoveryNode`` is the parent to these two subtrees, which means, that if the ``NavigateWithReplanning`` subtree returns ``FAILURE``,
the ``RecoveryFallback`` subtree will be ticked. 
* If the ``RecoveryFallback`` subtree then returns ``SUCCESS`` then ``NavigateWithReplanning`` will be executed again.
* Otherwise, if the ``RecoveryFallback`` returns ``FAILURE`` (this is not likely ... more on that later), then the overall tree will try again as determined by the parameter ``number_of_retries``.
* If the ``number_of_retries`` is exceeded, the overall tree will return ``FAILURE``.

The default ``navigate_w_replanning_and_recovery`` has a ``number_of_retries`` of 6, but this parameter should be changed if your use case has more or less acceptable retries.

.. code-block:: xml

    <RecoveryNode number_of_retries="6" name="NavigateRecovery">

For more details regarding the ``RecoveryNode`` please see the `configuration guide <../../configuration/packages/bt-plugins/controls/RecoveryNode.html>`_.

Note that the ``RecoveryNode`` is a custom ``control`` type node made for Nav2, but can be replaced by any other control type node based on the application. 
Replacements in the BT goes without saying for any node, and from here on out I will only call this out for particularly interesting subsitutions.

Navigation Subtree
======================

Now that we have gone over the control flow between the Navigation Subtree and the Recovery Subtree, 
let's focus on the Navigation Subtree, the main navigation subtree where we hope your robot will spend most of it's time. 
|

 .. image:: images/custom_behavior_tree/navigation_subtree.png
    :align: center

|         

The XML of this subtree is as follows:

.. code-block:: xml

    <PipelineSequence name="NavigateWithReplanning">
    <RateController hz="1.0">
        <RecoveryNode number_of_retries="1" name="ComputePathToPose">
            <ComputePathToPose goal="{goal}" path="{path}" planner_id="GridBased"/>
            <ReactiveFallback name="ComputePathToPoseRecoveryFallback">
                <GoalUpdated/>
                <ClearEntireCostmap name="ClearGlobalCostmap-Context" service_name="global_costmap/clear_entirely_global_costmap"/>
            </ReactiveFallback>
        </RecoveryNode>
    </RateController>
    <RecoveryNode number_of_retries="1" name="FollowPath">
        <FollowPath path="{path}" controller_id="FollowPath"/>
        <ReactiveFallback name="FollowPathRecoveryFallback">
            <GoalUpdated/>
            <ClearEntireCostmap name="ClearLocalCostmap-Context" service_name="local_costmap/clear_entirely_local_costmap"/>
        </ReactiveFallback>
    </RecoveryNode>
    </PipelineSequence>
                                 
The parent node of this subtree is ``PipelineSequence``, which is a custom Nav2 BT node.
While this subtree looks complicated, the crux of the tree can be represented with only one parent and two children nodes like this:

|

 .. image:: images/custom_behavior_tree/navigation_subtree_bare.png
    :align: center

|       

The other children and leaves of the tree are simply to throttle, handle failures, and ensuring the robot is responsive to updated goals.

The ``PipelineSequence`` allows the ``ComputePathToPose`` to be ticked, and once that succeeds, ``FollowPath`` to be ticked.
The full description of this control node is in the `configuration guide <../../configuration/packages/bt-plugins/controls/PipelineSequence.html>`_.
In the above distillation of the BT, if ``ComputePathToPose`` or ``FollowPath`` return ``FAILURE``,
the parent ``PipelineSequence`` will also return ``FAILURE`` and will therefore the BT will tick the ``RecoveryFallback`` node.

However, in the full ``NavigateWithReplanning`` subtree, there are a few other nodes to consider.

For example, the ``RateController`` node simply helps keep planning at the specified frequency. The default frequency for this BT is 1 hz. 
This is done to prevent the BT from hitting the planning server with too many useless requests at the tree update rate (100Hz). Consider changing this frequency to something higher or lower depending on the application and the computational cost of 
calculating the path. 

The next child in this tree is the ``RecoveryNode``, which wraps two children,  the ``ComputePathToPose`` and the ``ReactiveFallback``.
Recall from above that the ``RecoveryNode`` will return ``SUCCESS`` 
if ``ComputePathToPose`` returns ``SUCCESS`` or if ``ComputePathToPose`` returns ``FAILURE`` but the ``ReactiveFallback`` returns ``SUCCESS``. 
It will return ``FAILURE`` if both ``ComputePathToPose`` and the ``ReactiveFallback`` returns ``FAILURE``, or if the ``number_of_retries`` is violated (in this case one retry is allowed) .. which will then  cause the BT to enter the ``RecoveryFallback`` subtree.

Consider changing the ``number_of_retries`` parameter in the BT if your application requires more retries before a recovery action is triggered.

The ``ComputePathToPose`` is a simple action client to the ``ComputePathToPose`` ROS 2 action server.
The guide to configure this action node can be found in the `compute path configuration guide <../../configuration/packages/bt-plugins/actions/ComputePathToPose.html>`_.

Finally the ``ReactiveFallback`` node simply will tick it's 2nd child, ``ClearEntireCostmap`` *unless* the state of the condition node ``GoalUpdated`` returns ``SUCCESS`` (when, as the name suggests, the goal is updated).
In essence, the global costmap will be cleared unless the goal has been updated. ``ClearEntireCostmap`` is a recovery action that implements the ``clear_entirely_costmap`` service. 
In this case, the BT has set this to the global costmap, which makes sense as the global costmap would be the costmap that would affect the robot's ability to ``ComputePathToPose``.
                                                      
Now that we have covered the structure of the first major subtree, the ``ComputePathToPose`` subtree, the ``FollowPath`` subtree is largely symetric.

The ``FollowPath`` action node implements the action client to the ``FollowPath`` ROS 2 action server.
The guide to configure this action node can be found in the `follow path configuration guide <../../configuration/packages/bt-plugins/actions/FollowPath.html>`_.

If the ``FollowPath`` action node returns ``SUCCESS`` then this overall subtree will return ``SUCCESS``,
however if ``FollowPath`` returns ``FAILURE`` then the ``RecoveryNode`` will tick the ``ReactiveFallback``
which will tick ``ClearEntireCostmap`` (local) *unless* the ``GoalUpdated`` return ``SUCCESS``.
The local costmap makes sense to clear in this case as it is the costmap that would impede the robot's ability to follow the path.

In both of these subtrees, checking the ``GoalUpdated`` condition node is what gives this subtree  the name ``NavigateWithReplanning``.

We have now gone completely over the possibilities and actions in the ``NavigateWithReplanning``,
let's move on to the ``RecoveryFallback`` subtree, which will be ticked if the ``NavigateWithReplanning`` overall returns ``FAILURE``. The most likely scenario for 
this subtree to return ``FAILURE`` if the ``number_of_retries`` is violated on the ``RecoveryNode`` that wraps either the ``ComputePathToPose`` action, or the ``FollowPath`` action.

Recovery Subtree
================
The recovery fallback subtree is the second big "half" of the Nav2 default ``navigate_w_replanning_and_recovery.xml`` tree.
In short, this subtree is triggered when the ``NavigateWithReplanning`` subtree returns ``FAILURE`` and this subtree helps select the appropriate recovery to be taken based on how many previous times the recovery and the ``NavigateWithReplanning`` subtree returns ``FAILURE``.
                               
|

 .. image:: images/custom_behavior_tree/recovery_subtree.png
    :align: center

|         

And the XML snippet:

.. code-block:: xml

    <ReactiveFallback name="RecoveryFallback">
        <GoalUpdated/>
        <RoundRobin name="RecoveryActions">
            <Sequence name="ClearingActions">
                <ClearEntireCostmap name="ClearLocalCostmap-Subtree" service_name="local_costmap/clear_entirely_local_costmap"/>
                <ClearEntireCostmap name="ClearGlobalCostmap-Subtree" service_name="global_costmap/clear_entirely_global_costmap"/>
            </Sequence>
            <Spin spin_dist="1.57"/>
            <Wait wait_duration="5"/>
            <BackUp backup_dist="0.15" backup_speed="0.025"/>
        </RoundRobin>
    </ReactiveFallback>

The top most parent is ``ReactiveFallback`` which dictates that unless ``GoalUpdated`` returns ``SUCCESS``, tick the 2nd child (in  this case the ``RoundRobin``.
This should look familiar to the replanning portions of the ``NavigateWithReplanning`` tree. This is a common BT pattern to handle the situation "Unless 'this condition' happens, Do action A".

Condition nodes can be very powerful, and other custom Nav2 condition nodes include:
- DistanceTraveled
- GoalReached
- isBatteryLow
- TimeExpired

These condition nodes can be extremely powerful and are typically paired with ``ReactiveFallback``. It can be easy to imagine wrapping this whole ``navigate_w_replanning_and_recovery`` tree
in a ``ReactiveFallback`` with a ``isBatteryLow`` condition -- meaning the ``navigate_w_replanning_and_recovery`` tree will execute *unless* the battery becomes low (and then entire a different subtree for docking to recharge). 

If ``GoalUpdated`` returns ``FAILURE``, then the BT moves on to tick the ``RoundRobin`` node.
``RoundRobin`` is a custom Nav2 node. This control node will keep on ticking the subsequent child, until ``SUCCESS`` is achieved.
Before ``RoundRobin`` is explained in detail, let's describe what the ``Sequence`` node is. The ``Sequence`` node will tick both of the ``ClearLocalCostmap`` and if that returns ``SUCCESS`` will return ``ClearGlobalCostmap``.
If either of the children of the ``Sequence`` node returns ``FAILURE`` so will the node itself. Additionally, note that the ``Spin`` and ``BackUp`` nodes are clients to the Nav2 Recovery server.
In case a custom recovery action is needed, it can be useful to refer to the source of ``Spin`` ``BackUp`` and ``Wait`` as a reference.

To explain ``RoundRobin`` more clearly, let us assume that the robot is stuck somewhere and we are in this ``RecoveryFallback`` subtree for the first time:

- In the first time, ``RoundRobin`` will tick it's first child, ``Sequence``. Let's assume that these costmap clearing actions return ``SUCCESS``. 
- Upon the ``SUCCESS`` of the ``Sequence`` child (which just means that the costmaps were correctly cleared), the robot will attempt to renavigate in the ``NavigateWithReplanning`` subtree.
- Let's say that clearing the costmaps were not enough, the robot is **still** stuck. Upon entering the ``RoundRobin`` portion of the ``RecoveryFallback`` subtree, the subtree will tick the next child ``Spin``. ``RoundRobin`` retains a memory of nodes visited, and will **not** try to re-clear the costmaps again in this recovery.
- Regardless if ``Spin`` returns ``FAILURE`` or ``SUCCESS`` the next time this portion of the subtree enters, the next subsequent child will be ticked (in this case ``Wait``), and so on. Upon reaching the last child (in this case ``BackUp``), the node will wrap around and tick the ``ClearCostmapSequence`` again. 

``RoundRobin`` will only overall return ``FAILURE`` if **all** children return ``FAILURE``. 

Further details about the ``RoundRobin`` node can be found in the `round robin configuration guide <../../configuration/packages/bt-plugins/controls/RoundRobin.html>`_.
