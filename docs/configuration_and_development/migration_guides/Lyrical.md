### Static Layer Overlays Without Resizing the Master

[PR #6488](https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2/pull/6488) adds the Static Layer parameter `resize_master`, which defaults to `true`. Existing configurations require no changes: a Static Layer still resizes a non-rolling master costmap to match its incoming map.

Set `resize_master: false` for additional Static Layers whose maps should not control the master's geometry. For example, a Vector Object Server can publish an obstacle map with a smaller or changing extent while the primary Static Layer continues to own the site map geometry.
