Follow Dynamic Point
####################


This behavior tree implements a navigation behavior from a starting point, attempting to follow a dynamic point over time.
This "dynamic point" could be a person, another robot, a virtual carrot, anything.
The only requirement is that the pose you'd like to follow is published to the topic outlined in the ``GoalUpdater`` BT node.

In this tree, we replan at 1 hz just as we did in :ref:`behavior_tree_nav_to_pose` using the ``ComputePathToPose`` node.
However, this time when we replan, we update the ``goal`` based on the newest information in on the updated goal topic.
After we plan a path to this dynamic point, we use the ``TruncatePath`` node to remove path points from the end of the path near the dynamic point.
This behavior tree node is useful so that the robot always remains at least ``distance`` away from the obstacle, even if it stops.
It also smooths out any off path behavior involved with trying to path plan towards a probably occupied space in the costmap.

After the new path to the dynamic point is computed and truncated, it is again passed to the controller via the ``FollowPath`` node.
However, note that it is under a ``KeepRunningUntilFailure`` decorator node ensuring the controller continues to execute until a failure mode.
This behavior tree will execute infinitely in time until the navigation request is preempted or cancelled.
