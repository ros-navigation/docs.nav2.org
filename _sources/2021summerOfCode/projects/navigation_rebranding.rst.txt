.. _rebranding:


5. Navigation Branding and Website
==================================

**Task description** 

Navigation2 has made significant strides to be the best navigation system in the world. Over time, the original navigation stack in ROS has gained a reputation, fair or unfair, of being relatively limited in the types of tasks it can accomplish that are no longer true in ROS 2 Navigation2.

As such, we would like to initiate a re-branding effort to help differentiate it from its foundings. `MoveIt <https://moveit.ros.org/>`_ has a high-quality landing page with consistent graphics, color schemes, logos, and a catchy name. Your task will be to create a logo, color scheme, and work with maintainers to develop a new name to use in creating a new website for Navigation2. The `existing website <https://navigation.ros.org/>`_ is a Read The Docs design with just the technical tutorials and details. We would like the new Navigation2 website to be analog to the MoveIt website and allow for future expansions such as a blog and pages highlighting demos and robots using the framework.
