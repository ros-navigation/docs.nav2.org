``<name>`` is the corresponding planner plugin ID selected for this type.

Note: State Lattice does not have the costmap downsampler due to the minimum control sets being tied with map resolutions on generation. The minimum turning radius is also not a parameter in State Lattice since this was specified at the minimum control set pre-computation phase. See the Smac Planner package to generate custom control sets for your vehicle or use one of our pre-generated examples.

The image above you can see the reverse expansion enabled, such that the robot can back into a tight requested spot close to an obstacle.

Parameters

  ------ -------
  double 0.25            
  ====== =======

  Description
    If an exact path cannot be found, the tolerance (as measured by the heuristic cost-to-goal) that would be acceptable to diverge from the requested pose in distance-to-goal.

:``<name>``.max_iterations:

  ==== =======
  Type Default                                                   
  ---- -------
  int  1000000            
  ==== =======

  Description
    Maximum number of search iterations before failing to limit compute time, disabled by -1.
    
:``<name>``.max_on_approach_iterations:

  ==== =======
  Type Default                                                   
  ---- -------
  int  1000            
  ==== =======

  Description
    Maximum number of iterations once a visited node is within the goal tolerances to continue to try to find an exact match before returning the best path solution within tolerances.

:``<name>``.max_planning_time:

  ====== =======
  Type   Default                                                   
  ------ -------
  double  5.0            
  ====== =======

  Description

:``<name>``.analytic_expansion_ratio:

  ====== =======
  Type   Default                                                   
  ------ -------
  double 3.5            
  ====== =======

  Description
    SE2 node will attempt to complete an analytic expansion with frequency proportional to this value and the minimum heuristic. Negative values convert to infinite.

:``<name>``.analytic_expansion_max_length:

  ====== =======
  Type   Default                                                   
  ------ -------
  double 3.0            
  ====== =======

  Description
    If the length is too far, reject this expansion. This prevents shortcutting of search with its penalty functions far out from the goal itself (e.g. so we don't reverse half-way across open maps or cut through high cost zones). This should never be smaller than 4-5x the minimum turning radius being used, or planning times will begin to spike.

:``<name>``.reverse_penalty:

  ====== =======

  ------ -------
  double 2.0          
  ====== =======

  Description
    Heuristic penalty to apply to SE2 node if searching in reverse direction. Only used in ``allow_reverse_expansion = true``.

:``<name>``.change_penalty:

  Description
    Heuristic penalty to apply to SE2 node if changing direction (e.g. left to right) in search.

:``<name>``.non_straight_penalty:

  ====== =======
  Type   Default                                                   
  ------ -------
  double 1.05

  ------ -------
  double 2.0         
  ====== =======

  Description
    Heuristic penalty to apply to SE2 node for cost at pose. Allows State Lattice to be cost aware.

:``<name>``.rotation_penalty:

  ====== =======
  Type   Default                                                   
  ------ -------
  double 5.0         
  ====== =======

  Description
    Penalty to apply for rotations in place, if minimum control set contains in-place rotations. This should always be set sufficiently high to weight against in-place rotations unless strictly necessary for obstacle avoidance or there may be frequent discontinuities in the plan where the plan requests the robot to rotate in place to short-cut an otherwise smooth forward-moving path for marginal path distance savings.

:``<name>``.retrospective_penalty:

  ====== =======
  Type   Default                                                   
  ------ -------
  double 0.015         
  ====== =======

  Description
    Heuristic penalty to apply to SE2 node penalty. Causes State Lattice to prefer later maneuvers before earlier ones along the path. Saves search time since earlier (shorter) branches are not expanded until it is necessary. Must be >= 0.0 and <= 1.0. Must be `0.0` to be fully admissible. 

:``<name>``.lattice_filepath:

  ====== =======
  Type   Default                                                   
  ------ -------
  string ""         
  ====== =======

  Description
    The filepath to the state lattice minimum control set graph, this will default to a 16 bin, 0.5m turning radius control set located in ``test/`` for basic testing and evaluation (opposed to Hybrid-A*'s default of 0.5m).

:``<name>``.lookup_table_size:

:``<name>``.cache_obstacle_heuristic:

  ====== =======
  Type   Default                                                   
  ------ -------
  bool   false         
  ====== =======

  Description
    Cache the obstacle map dynamic programming distance expansion heuristic between subsiquent replannings of the same goal location. Dramatically speeds up replanning performance (40x) if costmap is largely static.

:``<name>``.allow_reverse_expansion:

  ====== =======
  Type   Default                                                   
  ------ -------
  bool   false      
  ====== =======

  Description
    If true, allows the robot to use the primitives to expand in the mirrored opposite direction of the current robot's orientation (to reverse).

  ------ -------
  bool   true      
  ====== =======

  Description
    If true, does simple and fast smoothing post-processing to the path from search

:``<name>``.smoother.max_iterations:

  ====== =======
  Type   Default                                                   
  ------ -------
  int    1000         
  ====== =======

  Description
    The maximum number of iterations the smoother has to smooth the path, to bound potential computation.

:``<name>``.smoother.w_smooth:

  ====== =======
  Type   Default                                                   
  ------ -------
  double 0.3         
  ====== =======

  Description

:``<name>``.smoother.w_data:

  Type   Default                                                   
  ------ -------

  ------ -------
  bool   true       
  ====== =======

  Description
    Performs extra refinement smoothing runs. Essentially, this recursively calls the smoother using the output from the last smoothing cycle to further smooth the path for macro-trends. This typically improves quality especially in the Hybrid-A* planner but can be helpful on the state lattice planner to reduce the "blocky" movements in State Lattice caused by the limited number of headings.

:``<name>``.smoother.refinement_num:

  ============== ===========================
  Type           Default                    
  -------------- ---------------------------
  int            2   
  ============== ===========================

  Description
    Number of times to recursively attempt to smooth, must be ``>= 1``.
