Overview
========
This tutorial walks a user through generating a graph for the nav2 route server.

Requirements
============
Follow https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html to install QGIS.

Tutorial Steps
==============


1- Create New QGIS Project
--------------------------

Open QGIS and create a new project by selecting `Project->New`. Save your project by selecting, `Project -> Save As`.
Set the project coordinate reference system by selecting `Project->Properties->CRS`. Set the coordinate system to `WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator` and click `OK`.


.. note::
    The `WGS 84/ Pseudo-Mercator` is one of few coordinate systems that could be used.
    For more information about coordinate reference systems please review https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/coordinate_reference_systems.html.

2- Setup Coordinate System
--------------------------

By default, the imported raster image origin will be at the top left corner, with x pointing to the right, and y pointing up.
To correctly set the origin and the resolution we will georeference the raster image.
To georeference the image, three control points will chosen. Each control point maps a pixel location to the spatial reference.

For example, let's say you have a 100 by 200 raster image with a resolution of 0.05 and a origin in the bottom left corner.
The first control point we could select is (0, -200)px -> (0, 0)m. (0, -200)px is the bottom left corner in the pixel frame and (0, 0)m is coordinates in the spatial frame.
This is the convention of our ROS maps, typically.
For the second control point we will select the top left corner of the image as the original (0, 0)px. The associated coordinates in the spatial frame can be calculated by using the resolution
to convert the pixels to meters. In this case, (0, 0)px -> (0, 10)m. Where 10 m is 200 px* 0.05 m/px. The last control will be the bottom right corner: (100, -200)px -> (5, 0)m.
It is recommended to set the origin of your map to the lower left corner of the image (``[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]`` in your ``map.yaml``), to make this process easier.

To georeference image select `Raster -> Georefencer`. Set the `Transformation Settings` to `Linear` for `Transformation
type`, `WGS 84/ Pseudo-Mercator` for `Target SRS` and set your desired path for the `Output Raster`.

Select the raster image you wish to georeference and place control point by selecting `Add Point` and clicking on the raster image.
The control points can be modified by clicking on the control point table and typing in new values. Once you are satisfied with your control points, apply the transformation
by selecting `Start Transformation`.

|

Close the window. Drag and drop the georeferenced raster file that was just created into the layers window. This should be a tiff file, by default.

|

To verify the transformation worked, move the mouse around the raster image and look at the coordinates being displayed at the bottom of the window.

3- Add Nodes
------------

Now that we have georeferenced the raster layer we can start placing nodes.


Select `Layer -> Create Layer -> New ShapeFile Layer`. Set the shapefile layer setting to be
`nodes` for the `File name`, `Point` for the `Geometry type` and `WGS 84/ Pseudo-Mercator` for the coordinate system. Press `OK`.

|

 .. image:: ../images/route_graph_generation/node_layer.png
    :height: 520px
    :width: 440px
    :align: center

|

In order to have the `id` field auto increment, right click on the layer and select the `Properties -> Attribute Form`.
Expand the `Fields` drop down menu and select `id`. Select the `Expression Dialog` icon which is across from `Default value` field.

|

 .. image:: ../images/route_graph_generation/attribute_form.png
    :height: 390px
    :width: 550px
    :align: center

|


Within the `Expression Dialog` select `Import user expressions` and import `increment_node_id.json` which exists in the scripts file with the nav2 route module. Expand `User expressions` and double click on `increment_node_id`.
The expression should show up in the left window. Click `OK` to save the expression and exit the `Expression Dialog`. Then click `Apply` and `OK` and save and exit the `Attributes Form`.
This will increment the node `id` by one every time a new node is added. The first node `id` will be zero.

|

 .. image:: ../images/route_graph_generation/expression_dialog.png
    :height: 380px
    :width: 470px
    :align: center

|


Click on the node layer and then select `Toggle Editing` icon represented as a pencil to start editing the layer.
To add points, select the `Add Point Feature`. Start adding nodes by clicking in the main window.
Each time a node is added, a window will pop up with the auto incremented id. Press `OK` to continue placing points.
Once complete, unselect 'Toggle Editing' and save changes.

|

    :align: center

|

.. note::
    By default, if a is node deleted the id list will not be updated. It is up to the user to determine how they wish to update the ids if individual
    or multiple nodes are deleted. Any node that is added will continue to increment based on the highest id, to ensure existing node are not automatically renumbered, breaking user implicit knowledge about the structure of the graph. This value can be overwritten by the user
    though the pop window after node placement or though the `Attribute Table`. To delete features in a layer right click on the layer and select `Open Attribute Table`.
    Click on `Target Multi Edit Mode`, select the features to delete, and click on the trash can icon.


4- Add Edges
------------

Now an edge layer can be created. Select `Layer -> Create Layer -> New ShapeFile Layer`. Set the shapefile layer setting to be
`edges` for the `File name`, `LineString` for the `Geometry type` and `WGS 84/ Pseudo-Mercator` for the coordinate system. Press `OK`.
To auto increment the `id` field follow the same steps as above except replace `increment_node_id.json` with `increment_edge_id.json`.
This will increment the edge `id` by one every time a new edge is added. The first edge `id` will be `10000`.

|

 .. image:: ../images/route_graph_generation/edge_layer.png
    :height: 520px
    :width: 440px
    :align: center

|

To see the directionality of the edges, right click on the edge layer and select `Properties`. Click `Symbology -> Simple Line` and change the `Symbol layer type` to `Arrow`.
Click `Ok`. You should now be able to see arrows for each line string. Note that all edges in the route graph are directional, so if you want a bidirectional connection you should duplicate it in reverse.

Click on the edge layer and then on the `Toggle Editing` icon represented as a pencil to start editing the layer.
To add edges, click on the `Add Line Feature`. Start adding edges by clicking twice in the main window.
(First point is start, second point is end). Press right click anywhere when you have finished adding the two points for the prompt to save to come up.
The edge locations must exactly match up to the node locations, so if Snapping is not already enabled by default, enable it via Views->Toolbars->Snapping Toolbar and depress the Magnet icon.
Once complete, unselect 'Toggle Editing' and save changes.

5- Associate Nodes With Edges
-----------------------------

Now that we have our node and edge layers, we can associate node IDs with edge IDs.
Select `Database -> DB manager`. Expand `Virtual layers` and expand `Project layers`. Open up
the SQL window by clicking on the script icon in the top left corner. In the SQL window load in `generate_start_and_end_id.sql` by selecting `Load File`.
The script can found within the scripts directory in the nav2_route module.
Execute the script. Load the new layer by checking the `Load as new layer` box and clicking `Load`. The script associates the start and end of a line string by matching the node
point. Then export the layer as a ShapeFile by right clicking on the layer selecting `Export -> Save Feature As`. Change the format to type to `ESRI Shapefile`, name the file, and verify that the
coordinate reference system is `WGS 84 /Pseudo-Mercator`. Press `OK`.

6- Export To Geojson
--------------------

We are now ready to export the node and edge layer as geojson files. Execute `export_shapefiles.py <prefix_of_file> <path_to_edges_shapefile> <path_to_nodes_shapefile>`
within the scripts directory located in the nav2_route module. This script converts the nodes and edges shape file into a geojson file.

7- Congratulations
------------------

Your graph is ready to be consumed by the nav2 route! If you wish to add nodes or edges to your graph,
edit the layers and repeat the process from step 5 to regenerate the graph. If you wish to adjust the graph, make sure `Editing` is toggled on for the
node and edge layer. Then select `Vertex Tool(all Layers)` and toggle on `Topological Editing`. Repeat the process from step 5 to regenerate the graph.

Happy Routing!
